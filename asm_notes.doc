 PROCESSING METHODS  
=====================
Library Creation
----------------
Stranded RNASeq library(s) were created and quantified by qPCR.
Sequencing was performed using an Illumina instrument.

Read preprocessing and filtering:
-------------------
Raw fastq file reads were filtered and trimmed resulting in the filtered fastq file (*filter-RNA.fastq.gz files).
BBDuk [1] was used to remove contaminants, trim reads that contained adapter sequence and right quality trim reads where quality drops to 0.
Using BBDuk, raw reads were evaluated for artifact sequence by kmer matching (kmer=25), allowing 1 mismatch and detected artifact was trimmed from the 3' end of the reads.  RNA spike-in reads and PhiX reads were removed. BBDuk was used to remove reads that contained 1 or more 'N' bases, had an average quality score across the read less than 10 or had a minimum length <= 51 bp or 33% of the full read length.  Reads mapped with BBMap [2] to masked human, cat, dog and mouse references at 93% identity were removed.  Reads aligned to common microbial contaminants were also removed.  Ribosomal RNA reads were also removed.
The "RNA" suffix in the filtered fastq file names means the files were filtered using the transcriptome filtering options.

Read Alignment and Counting
---------------------------
The reads from each library were aligned to the reference genome using BBMap [2] with only unique mappings allowed (BAMs/ directory). If a read mapped to more than one location it was ignored. featureCounts [3] was used to generate the raw gene counts (raw_counts.txt file).  Raw gene counts were used to evaluate the level of correlation between biological samples using Pearson's correlation (replicate_analysis.txt, replicate_analysis_heatmap.pdf). Counts refer to fragments, for example if the library was a paired end run where both reads aligned to the same feature/gene in the reference genome then it would be represented as a count of 1 in the raw gene counts.

Genome Reference
---------------------------
The IMG Taxonoid used for retrieving the genome reference (fasta) and gff3 file for BBMap alignment is: 650377924
For details on the commands used, please see the README files.




Normalization used
---------------------------
The raw gene counts were normalized to adjust for the length of each gene and total number of reads mapped for each library. The normalization formula used:
n = ( r / ( l / 1000 ) ) / ( t / 1000000 )
n = normalized read count for gene G for library L
r = raw read count for gene G for library L
l = gene G length
t = total reads mapped for library L
